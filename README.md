# Digital Portfolio

Welcome to my Digital Portfolio project! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and accomplishments in web development, specifically utilizing the Vue 3 framework in combination with Vite.

## Description

This project represents my personal digital portfolio, designed and developed with Vue 3 and Vite. A portfolio is more than just a collection of projects; it's a reflection of my journey, growth, and dedication in the field of web development. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my coding proficiency, design sensibilities, and problem-solving abilities.

## Recommended IDE Setup

To ensure seamless development, I recommend using the following IDE setup:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (disable Vetur)
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)

## Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

```sh
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Further Customization

For further customization of the project configuration, refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
